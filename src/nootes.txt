*In react variables are use for static rendering of data
*Isssue is that as coponent rendered firsttime the currentvalue of variable 
is used in prograam
*you can update the value of the component only through functions but
 it is not use in program
*when the variable value updated thanks to user interactivity the new value is not
visible/use in the program as component donot rerendered again 
*for these reasons state is introduced in react
*)you can update the value in react through document method like getElementById but
it is like jugar in react

--Hooks (useState)

*there is a standard in naming hooks like always atrat with 'use
*useState return and array containing two elelment 
*first is the argumetn we passed to it and second is the function 
*)we destructurer the array return by useState with counter and setCounter
*)setCounter is the function name and counter is value
*)we use the counter and increment it whenever button is pressed
*)onClick event calls the setCounter function and provide it with the updated vlue
*)this updated value become the value of the counter


--todo


*it is important to make new reference of the data when you add new value in array as react will not get that a value is updated as it still shares the old reference
