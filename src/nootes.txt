*In react variables are use for static rendering of data
*Isssue is that as coponent rendered firsttime the currentvalue of variable 
is used in prograam
*you can update the value of the component only through functions but
 it is not use in program
*when the variable value updated thanks to user interactivity the new value is not
visible/use in the program as component donot rerendered again 
*for these reasons state is introduced in react
*)you can update the value in react through document method like getElementById but
it is like jugar in react
